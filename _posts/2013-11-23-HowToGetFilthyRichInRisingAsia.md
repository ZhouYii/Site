<p>The conditions in Asia described in the book is largely in line with what is portrayed by mass media, which leads me to doubt if the author is being wholly genuine. However, the situations faced by the protagonist are certainly believable. </p>

<p>Asia is said to be a country that is leaving it's rural background and embracing industrialism. In a way, this movement towards industrialism provides the impetus for the entire story; if the author had never moved to the city, it is unlikely that he would have found the mentors he found and worked at the jobs he worked at. If all citizens were to embrace the industrial life and move to the cities, then who would replace them at the jobs they leave behind? Perhaps nobody wants to live in the life of a rural farmer, and there are similarly many undesirable jobs in the industrialized world. Perhaps we simply do not see them. I am speaking of the hidden, shameful jobs that people would take only out of desperation. Usually an illegal migrant worker is forced to work long hours at a factory, or do some hazardous job for a paltry wage and yet cannot complain for fear of being sent away.</p> 
<p>Though these people hold undesirable position and work unseen, they are part of a vital infrastructure that keeps everything running smoothly and cleanly. In this story, then, who are the ones to replace the farmers who move away to find work in the city? Perhaps nobody has to. As long as there are rural villages and land in existence, technology will provide for the productivity lost from villagers migrating to the cities.</p>
<p>The narrative style of this book was very original. The author starts each chapter as if it were a self-help book and uses that as a segue to tell the story. Each story was somewhat disconnected from each of the previous stories since there are usually a period of years between each chapter of the story.</p>
